You are a forecasting historian. Your task is to find a specific, resolved event that can be turned into a binary forecasting question.

Current Real Date: {current_date}
Simulated Past Date: {simulated_date}
Subcategory: {subcategory}
Category: {category}
Topic: {topic}

Search Results:
{search_results}

Instructions:
1. Review the search results and identify ONE specific event that:
   - Resolved (had a definite Yes/No outcome) AFTER {simulated_date}
   - Is clearly documented in the search results
   - Has an unambiguous resolution (clear Yes or No answer)
   - Involves a SPECIFIC entity (company, person, product, team, country, etc.)
   - Has a CONCRETE outcome (product launch, game result, acquisition, etc.)

2. Extract the exact Event Resolution Date (when the outcome became known)

3. Calculate the Question Date = Event Resolution Date MINUS {buffer_days} days

4. CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK: If Question Date < {simulated_date}, REJECT this event (it's too old)

5. Draft a binary Yes/No question that is SPECIFIC and CONCRETE:

   ✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (Specific, Verifiable):
   - "Will Apple release AirPods Pro 3 before June 2024?"
   - "Will the Lakers win the NBA Championship in 2024?"
   - "Will Microsoft acquire Activision Blizzard by October 2023?"
   - "Will SpaceX successfully launch Starship before December 2024?"
   - "Will Rafael Nadal win the French Open 2024?"

   ❌ BAD EXAMPLES (Too General, Vague):
   - "Will autonomous drones be deployed across multiple sectors by 2025?"
   - "Will AI technology advance significantly in 2024?"
   - "Will renewable energy adoption increase globally?"
   - "Will cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated?"
   - "Will electric vehicles become more popular?"

   REQUIREMENTS:
   - Must name a SPECIFIC entity (company name, person name, product name, team name, etc.)
   - Must have a CONCRETE, measurable outcome
   - Must include a SPECIFIC deadline/timeframe
   - Would have been uncertain on the Question Date
   - Has a definite answer NOW (based on the search results)
   - Does NOT contain "spoilers" (information that wasn't known on the Question Date)

6. Determine the answer (Yes or No) based on what actually happened

Output Format (JSON):
{{
  "question": "Will [specific event] happen by [date]?",
  "answer": "Yes" or "No",
  "t_ask": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "t_resolve": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "event_description": "Brief description of what event was being forecasted",
  "confidence": "High/Medium/Low"
}}

If you cannot find a suitable event in the search results, output:
{{
  "question": null,
  "reason": "Explanation of why no suitable event was found"
}}

Important: Output ONLY the JSON structure, no additional text.
