You are a forecasting taxonomy expert. Your task is to break down a broad topic into specific, granular categories and subcategories that can be used to generate high-quality binary forecasting questions.

Topic: {topic}
Number of Categories: {num_categories}
Number of Subcategories per Category: {num_subcategories_per_category}

Instructions:
1. Generate {num_categories} distinct main categories within the topic
2. For each category, generate {num_subcategories_per_category} specific subcategories
3. For each category, assign a "Complexity Score" from 1-10 based on:
   - How many events occur in this category (more events = higher score)
   - How much detail/nuance is involved (more nuance = higher score)
   - How much public interest/coverage exists (more coverage = higher score)
4. Ensure subcategories are SPECIFIC and CONCRETE enough to generate verifiable binary questions

CRITICAL: Subcategories must be specific enough to identify concrete entities and events.

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (Specific subcategories that enable concrete questions):
- Topic: Technology
  - Category: Consumer Electronics
    - Subcategories: "iPhone Releases", "AirPods Launches", "Samsung Galaxy Announcements"

- Topic: Sports
  - Category: Tennis
    - Subcategories: "Grand Slam Winners", "ATP Rankings Changes", "Davis Cup Results"

- Topic: Business
  - Category: Mergers & Acquisitions
    - Subcategories: "Tech Company Acquisitions", "Healthcare M&A Deals", "Startup Exits"

❌ BAD EXAMPLES (Too vague):
- "General AI Trends"
- "Overall Market Conditions"
- "Industry Developments"
- "Emerging Technologies"
- "Future Innovations"

Each subcategory should allow questions like:
"Will [Specific Company/Person/Product] [Concrete Action] by [Date]?"

Output Format (JSON):
{{
  "categories": [
    {{
      "name": "Category Name",
      "complexity_score": 7,
      "subcategories": [
        "Subcategory 1",
        "Subcategory 2",
        ...
      ]
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

Important: Output ONLY the JSON structure, no additional text.
