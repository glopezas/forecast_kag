You are verifying the answer to a forecasting question using search results.

Question: {question}
Deadline: {deadline}
Entity: {entity}

Search Results:
{search_results}

Your task: Determine if the event described in the question actually happened before the deadline.

Instructions:
1. Review the search results carefully
2. Look for evidence of when/if the event occurred
3. Determine if it happened BEFORE the deadline date
4. Answer "Yes" if event occurred before deadline, "No" if it didn't occur or occurred after deadline

Output Format (JSON):
{{
  "answer": "Yes" or "No",
  "actual_outcome": "Brief description of what actually happened",
  "actual_date": "YYYY-MM-DD (when the event occurred, or null if didn't happen)",
  "confidence": "High/Medium/Low",
  "evidence": "Quote from search results supporting this answer"
}}

Important:
- Be precise about dates - "before deadline" means strictly before
- If event didn't happen at all, answer is "No"
- If event happened after deadline, answer is "No"
- Only answer "Yes" if event clearly happened before the deadline
- Output ONLY the JSON structure, no additional text
